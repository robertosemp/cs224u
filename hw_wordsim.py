# ## Overview
# 
# Word similarity datasets have long been used to evaluate distributed representations. This notebook provides basic code for conducting such analyses with a number of datasets:
# 
# | Dataset | Pairs | Task-type | Current best Spearman $\rho$ | Best $\rho$ paper |   |
# |---------|-------|-----------|------------------------------|-------------------|---|
# | [WordSim-353](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gabr/resources/data/wordsim353/) | 353 | Relatedness | 82.8 | [Speer et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03975) |
# | [MTurk-771](http://www2.mta.ac.il/~gideon/mturk771.html) | 771 | Relatedness | 81.0 | [Speer et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03975) |
# | [The MEN Test Collection](http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/~elia.bruni/MEN) | 3,000 | Relatedness | 86.6 | [Speer et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03975)  | 
# | [SimVerb-3500-dev](http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/dsg40/simverb.html) | 500 | Similarity | 61.1 | [Mrki&scaron;&cacute; et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00892.pdf) |
# | [SimVerb-3500-test](http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/dsg40/simverb.html) | 3,000 | Similarity | 62.4 | [Mrki&scaron;&cacute; et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00892.pdf) |
# 
# Each of the similarity datasets contains word pairs with an associated human-annotated similarity score. (We convert these to distances to align intuitively with our distance measure functions.) The evaluation code measures the distance between the word pairs in your chosen VSM (which should be a `pd.DataFrame`).
# 
# The evaluation metric for each dataset is the [Spearman correlation coefficient $\rho$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient) between the annotated scores and your distances, as is standard in the literature. We also macro-average these correlations across the datasets for an overall summary. (In using the macro-average, we are saying that we care about all the datasets equally, even though they vary in size.)
# 
# This homework ([questions at the bottom of this notebook](#Homework-questions)) asks you to write code that uses the count matrices in `data/vsmdata` to create and evaluate some baseline models as well as an original model $M$ that you design. This accounts for 9 of the 10 points for this assignment.
# 
# For the associated bake-off, we will distribute two new word similarity or relatedness datasets and associated reader code, and you will evaluate $M$ (no additional training or tuning allowed!) on those new datasets. Systems that enter will receive the additional homework point, and systems that achieve the top score will receive an additional 0.5 points.

# ### PPMI as a baseline [0.5 points]
# 
# The insight behind PPMI is a recurring theme in word representation learning, so it is a natural baseline for our task. For this question, write a function called `run_giga_ppmi_baseline` that does the following:
# 
# 1. Reads the Gigaword count matrix with a window of 20 and a flat scaling function into a `pd.DataFrame`s, as is done in the VSM notebooks. The file is `data/vsmdata/giga_window20-flat.csv.gz`, and the VSM notebooks provide examples of the needed code.
# 
# 1. Reweights this count matrix with PPMI.
# 
# 1. Evaluates this reweighted matrix using `full_word_similarity_evaluation`. The return value of `run_giga_ppmi_baseline` should be the return value of this call to `full_word_similarity_evaluation`.
# 
# The goal of this question is to help you get more familiar with the code in `vsm` and the function `full_word_similarity_evaluation`.

# ### Gigaword with LSA at different dimensions [0.5 points]
# 
# We might expect PPMI and LSA to form a solid pipeline that combines the strengths of PPMI with those of dimensionality reduction. However, LSA has a hyper-parameter $k$ â€“ the dimensionality of the final representations â€“ that will impact performance. For this problem, write a wrapper function `run_ppmi_lsa_pipeline` that does the following:

# 1. Takes as input a count `pd.DataFrame` and an LSA parameter `k`.
# 1. Reweights the count matrix with PPMI.
# 1. Applies LSA with dimensionality `k`.
# 1. Evaluates this reweighted matrix using `full_word_similarity_evaluation`. The return value of `run_ppmi_lsa_pipeline` should be the return value of this call to `full_word_similarity_evaluation`.
# 
# The goal of this question is to help you get a feel for how much LSA alone can contribute to this problem.

# ### Gigaword with GloVe for a small number of iterations [0.5 points]
# 
# Ideally, we would run GloVe for a very large number of iterations on a GPU machine to compare it against its close cousin PMI. However, we don't want this homework to cost you a lot of money or monopolize a lot of your available computing resources, so let's instead just probe GloVe a little bit to see if it has promise for our task.

# 1. Reads in `data/vsmdata/giga_window20-flat.csv.gz`.
# 1. Runs GloVe for 10, 100, and 200 iterations on `data/vsmdata/giga_window20-flat.csv.gz`, using the `mittens` implementation of `GloVe`. 
#   * For all the other parameters to `mittens.GloVe` besides `max_iter`, use the package's defaults.
#   * Because of the way that implementation is designed, these will have to be separate runs, but they should be relatively quick. 
# 1. Stores the values in a `dict` mapping each `max_iter` value to its associated 'Macro-average' score according to `full_word_similarity_evaluation`. `run_small_glove_evals`  should return this `dict`.
# 
# The trend should give you a sense for whether it is worth running GloVe for more iterations.
# 
# Some implementation notes:
# 
# * Your trained GloVe matrix `X` needs to be wrapped in a `pd.DataFrame` to work with `full_word_similarity_evaluation`. `pd.DataFrame(X, index=giga20.index)` will do the trick.
# 
# * If `glv` is your GloVe model, then running `glv.sess.close()` after each model is trained will silence warnings from TensorFlow about interactive sessions being active.
# 
# Performance will vary a lot for this function, so there is some uncertainty in the testing, but `test_run_small_glove_evals` will at least check that you wrote a function with the right general logic.

# ### t-test reweighting [2 points]
# 
# 

# The t-test statistic can be thought of as a reweighting scheme. For a count matrix $X$, row index $i$, and column index $j$:
# 
# $$\textbf{ttest}(X, i, j) = 
# \frac{
#     P(X, i, j) - \big(P(X, i, *)P(X, *, j)\big)
# }{
# \sqrt{(P(X, i, *)P(X, *, j))}
# }$$
# 
# where $P(X, i, j)$ is $X_{ij}$ divided by the total values in $X$, $P(X, i, *)$ is the sum of the values in row $i$ of $X$ divided by the total values in $X$, and $P(X, *, j)$ is the sum of the values in column $j$ of $X$ divided by the total values in $X$.
# 
# For this problem, implement this reweighting scheme. You can use `test_ttest_implementation` below to check that your implementation is correct. You do not need to use this for any evaluations, though we hope you will be curious enough to do so!

To help you begin asssessing this idea, this question asks you to write a function that modifies an existing VSM so that the representation for each word $w$ is the element-wise sum of $w$'s original word-level representation with all the representations for the n-grams $w$ contains. 
# 
# The following starter code should help you structure this and clarify the requirements, and a simple test is included below as well.

# ### Your original system [3 points]
# 
# This question asks you to design your own model. You can of course include steps made above (ideally, the above questions informed your system design!), but your model should not be literally identical to any of the above models. Other ideas: retrofitting, autoencoders, GloVe, subword modeling, ... 
# 
# Requirements:
# 
# 1. Your code must operate on one of the count matrices in `data/vsmdata`. You can choose which one. __Other pretrained vectors cannot be introduced__.
# 
# 1. Your code must be self-contained, so that we can work with your model directly in your homework submission notebook. If your model depends on external data or other resources, please submit a ZIP archive containing these resources along with your submission.
# 
# In the cell below, please provide a brief technical description of your original system, so that the teaching team can gain an understanding of what it does. This will help us to understand your code and analyze all the submissions to identify patterns and strategies.

You will evaluate your custom model $M$ (from the previous question) on these new datasets using `full_word_similarity_evaluation`. Rules:
# 
# 1. Only one evaluation is permitted.
# 1. No additional system tuning is permitted once the bake-off has started.
# 
# The cells below this one constitute your bake-off entry.
# 
# People who enter will receive the additional homework point, and people whose systems achieve the top score will receive an additional 0.5 points. We will test the top-performing systems ourselves, and only systems for which we can reproduce the reported results will win the extra 0.5 points.
# 
# Late entries will be accepted, but they cannot earn the extra 0.5 points. Similarly, you cannot win the bake-off unless your homework is submitted on time.
